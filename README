1) checking out the code

scramv1  p -n CMSSW_4_2_3_Test CMSSW CMSSW_4_2_3
cd CMSSW_4_2_3_Test/src/
cmsenv

cvs co -d Smurf/Core UserCode/Smurf/Core
cvs co -d Smurf/Analysis UserCode/Smurf/Analysis
cvs co -d CMS2/NtupleMacros/Tools/ UserCode/JRibnik/CMS2/NtupleMacros/Tools/
cvs co -d CMS2/NtupleMacros/HZZ/ UserCode/DLEvans/HZZ/

The options you can choose from:

2) do DY background estimation

cd CMS2/NtupleMacros/HZZ/hww2012/dyBackground
make dy


3) do Top Estimation 

cd CMS2/NtupleMacros/HZZ/hww2012/topBackground
make top


4) do WW Estimation

cd CMS2/NtupleMacros/HZZ/hww2012/wwBackground
make ww


5) print out the input cards to the final analysis or the WW level yield

cd cd CMS2/NtupleMacros/HZZ/hww2012
make ww

*************
* You need to edit the doAllWW.C  * 
*************
Especially take care of the input data directories.
There are 3 types of data that can be used switched by 3 booleans
1) rawdata: raw smurf data typically from /smurf/data/ area
2) skimdata: skim data typically from user area 
3) skimdatawithmva: close to final shape analysis level data with bdt added to the smurf ntuples 

Note that the structure is set in such a way that 
you need to change by hand these *exclusive* bools

Final Note:

It looks deceively simple, but there are many many traps, the very 
first one is the setting up all the samples and auxilliary files
In each area of the code there is typically a looper and an analyzer. 
For instance for the main code that produces the final data cards, the 
looper is called SmurfLooper.cc, you need to make sure all the related 
histogram files are valid and reasonable. The relateve task is done by 
one script such as the doAllWW.C for the main analysis, or doDYEstimation.C
for the Drell-Yan estimation.
