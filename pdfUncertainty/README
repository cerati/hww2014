To make the code:
> make

To run the looper to produce histograms 
of the observable (MT-Mll plane) for each PDF subset:
> root -b -q doPDF.C

To take the envelope of the variations in
the appropriate (PDF4LHC) way
> mkdir results2
> root -b
> [] process2D.C+
> [] process2D("pdfUncertainties_hww_analysis21_125.root", "qqWW_DF_0j")
> [] process2D("pdfUncertainties_hww_analysis21_125.root", "qqWW_DF_1j")
> [] process2D("pdfUncertainties_hww_analysis21_125.root", "qqWW_DF_VBF")

The final results histogram is in

    results2/PDFUncertainty_qqWW_DF_0j.root
